Introduction to Aether
------------------------

Aether is geared towards a themer that utilizes sass/compass, 
it also aims to provide theme settings for tasks better handled 
on the Drupal theme layer, such as grid column sizes per region,
sidebar arrangements, grid debugging and polyfill selections.

This theme is a starter theme, with all the components you should 
need to build a fixed-width responsive site using re-usable CSS patterns, 
it supports (out of the box) Handheld Portrait, Handheld Landscape, 
Tablet Landscape, Tablet Portrait, & Desktop.

Installation of theme on Drupal 7
------------------------

- Download Aether from http://drupal.org/project/aether
- Unpack and place the Aether folder in your Drupal installation under
  one of the following locations:

    * sites/all/themes
    * sites/default/themes
    * sites/example.com/themes

- Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site and go to
  /Appearance (admin/appearance) and if you installed the theme
  properly you should see Aether and Aether Subtheme.

You do not need to enable the Aether Subtheme, but if you want a
quick preview, you can optionally make Aether Subtheme the default theme.
