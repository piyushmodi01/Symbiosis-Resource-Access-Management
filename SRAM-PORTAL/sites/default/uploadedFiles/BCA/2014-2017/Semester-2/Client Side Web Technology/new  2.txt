1). Events are nothing but change in the current state of an object.

2). Javascript defines 5 types of events which are form, image, image map, link and window events.

3). Form events.
	> blur = The input focus was lost.
	> change = An element lost the focus since it was changed.
	> focus = The input focus was obtained.
	> reset = The user reset the object, usually a form.
	> select = Some text is selected.
	> submit = The user submitted an object, usually a form.
	
4). Image events.
	> abort = A user action caused an abort.
	> error = An error occured.
	> load = The object was loaded.
	
5). Image Map events.
	> mouseOut = The mouse is moved from on top a link.
	> mouseOver = The mouse is moved over a link.
	
6). An action which needs to be performed after event triggers is written in "event handlers".

7). Event handlers are nothing but user-defined functions in javascript.

8). Link events.
	> click = An object was clicked.
	> mouseOut = The mouse is moved from on top a link.
	> mouseOver = The mouse is moved over a link.
	
9). Window events.
	> blur = The input focus was lost.
	> error = An error occured.
	> focus = The input focus was obtained.
	> load = The object was loaded.
	> unload = The object was not loaded.
