Regular Expressions in javascript:

Regular Expressions are used for validating the data which is entered by the user.

Basic syntax:-

var RegularExpression=/pattern/

a caret(^)may be used to indicate the beginning of the string
a dollar sign($)is used to mark the end.

Examples:-
1. javascript // Matches "Isn't javascript great?"
2. ^javascript // Matches "javascript rules!",
        // not "what is javascript?"
		
		
[] brackets use for single value.

? mean optional.
